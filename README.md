calculate_year_of_birth(current_year, age) Function:

This function takes two arguments: current_year and age.
It calculates the year of birth by subtracting the age from the current year.
It returns the calculated year of birth.
Main Program:

The program defines a constant CURRENT_YEAR which represents the current year (2024 in this case).
It prompts the user to enter their name and age.
Based on the provided age, it determines if the user is an adult or a minor.
It calls the calculate_year_of_birth() function to calculate the year of birth using the provided age.
Finally, it prints a personalized greeting message to the user, including their name, adult/minor status, and year of birth.
